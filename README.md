# AI-final-project

completed the below 2 problems. All work inside searchagents.py

1. Fill in foodHeuristic in searchAgents.py with a consistent heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem.
- my agent expands less than 7000 nodes using maze distance heuristic

2. Implement the function findPathToClosestDot in searchAgents.py. Our agent solves this maze (suboptimally!) in under a second with a path cost of 350.
- my agent has a path cost of exactly 350 as the problem requested.
